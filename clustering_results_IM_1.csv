"DJ, if I pull up 9WC0201, you're going to get a long list of company plants, different sub plants, and you're going to get some valid CLLI codes, and invalid ones.

49] It sounds like that didn't work. What did we do with the net pseudos?,-1,requesting clarification
"That was the lowly thing about net, is that each of the pseudos itself had the company code on there. In the net table itself, the CO profile table, there was that Infinium company code OAC in exchange field for each record.",-1,explaining a technical detail
That's because we went in and cleaned those up prior to passing the data to you.,-1,explaining completed work
"Which is going to be more difficult, and probably impossible to do in this case, because you could probably clean them up [indecipherable] extract 4, but then when we get the next extract, then there's going to be more stuff in there, potentially, that we haven't even considered. It would be nice if we had more broader swath.",-1,discussing data extraction challenges

"I said, I didn't finish my thought. Now remember, in Infinium, they don't even look at the CLLI code.

So, Infinium doesn't even look at these pseudo-CLLIs or CLLIs. Go ahead, DJ, I interrupted you to answer the other part.",40,explaining technical details
47] I just wanted to clarify.,46,seeking clarification
"No, that's good.",21,acknowledging completion

"No, it was out in California. 9WC was the company code.",-1,providing background information
"Since the Infinium folks are going to have to deal with this, probably on the case-by-case basis as they encounter the new sub plants, I assume, could we put maybe a placeholder on these that we can't figure out and get them in that way? And then they could be dealt with on the case-by-case basis as they get encountered in LCAM? Is that a possibility?",-1,requesting a provisional solution for unresolved items

I've had not a single problem matching up the exchange codes I've found back to that list, so I think that's perfect there.",-1,proposing a solution based on existing data
"50] The only thing that I would need to put in there would be a place holder for the exchange code, the company code, and the OAC. If we just came up with some sort of thing that, it's blatantly obvious to whoever's using that part of LCAM, goes, ""Oh, yeah, I know I need to do this when I come across this,"" then that would at least get [indecipherable] through this part to the next thing.",-1,requesting placeholder design guidance

"It was quite a while ago, and to be honest, it could have been you that said it or somebody else. Neither here nor there. That's the next barrier I'm coming across, is I need to know whether or not the G team's ship-to code is indeed a valid ship-to code for those locations that are in the extract. If they are, I'll need those addresses. I really just don't know where to find them, if they are in the extract or not.",-1,requesting information about data validity and addresses

"20] Some of that may be fallout, some of it may not. I've spot-checked several other and they weren't fallout so far, so there's this new [indecipherable 11:27] to us.

You don't have to stay.,-1,giving permission to leave
We had some questions. We're trying to understand...Let me just pull it up.,-1,expressing uncertainty and preparing to clarify
Can you see if Daryl is available?,-1,requesting availability check
"I don't have it on hand, but I can get started. Drake, we were on that call with Mike [indecipherable 15:25] . Remember, he had that flowchart of the interfaces between Infinium and CTDI, and LCAM and CTDI. You had identified two features or code changes that were outside the scope of the project. One of them was, where a part number and/or VIN changes.",102,referencing previous discussion and project scope
Yep.,1,noise
The other one was the nightly snapshots to check that we're all in sync.,-1,reporting progress on synchronization tasks
Yes.,1,expressing agreement
"Correct? OK. The first one...I took notes, plus I double-checked the CTDI. We were under the impression, for those MRs, the finance issues and whatever the MR, that those could be worked through the existing code of send and receive. I was a little confused why that would be outside the scope.",-1,expressing confusion
"26] Then the second one -- I thought, my notes were -- that LCAM agreed to just send a file [indecipherable 16:37] , like on an FTP server each night. Is that true?",51,asking for confirmation
"We hadn't decided. It could either be a service or a file, depending upon the size of that file, how much data...",-1,discussing implementation options
"Were you sending it to them, or they were sending it to you?",-1,requesting clarification
"No, we were creating, depending on which way we were doing it. If we create a service, they would pull it whenever they wanted. If it was an FTP, then we would send it to them or put it on the FTP site, daily or however often it was run.",-1,explaining data delivery methods
"To tackle the first one, first. You're saying that Mike suggested to use existing interfaces, is not appropriate or what...",-1,seeking clarification
The existing interface doesn't change part numbers now. We would either have to change the existing interface to make it change part numbers -- which is not what the interface is designed for -- or we create a new interface to allow them to change part numbers. That's all they're doing with it.,27,explaining design options for interface modification
"59] Either way, it'll be a change for us. It is not like we could just allow them to send it to the existing interface and it'll change the part with what they want.",27,explaining a technical constraint
Wasn't that a two part thing? One with...,-1,expressing uncertainty
"Yeah, part or a serial number. VIN number.",-1,providing clarification
"OK, but short of changing the part number, I thought the MR, the old part number would go out and the new one would come in.",27,clarifying a process or behavior
"Yeah, that's...",-1,noise
Would that really...?,-1,expressing confusion
We seem to have one that's still bringing back in...,-1,reporting a bug
"We're just trying to make sure, before we accept the digital feed that.",-1,clarifying requirements
We still wouldn't change that.,62,expressing status quo maintenance
We might need an expert. We're a little confused.,-1,expressing emotion
"Their proposal was to send it out as one part number and then we would send another message, have it coming back in as a different part number. Still, the code doesn't change the part number when it comes in, it [indecipherable 19:03] that VIN and moves that VIN where it needs to be. It doesn't change the base equipment on that, that VIN.",27,explaining current system behavior
[19:13] It wouldn't be treated like take the old one out and replace it with the new one?,-1,asking for clarification on process
"No. Basically it would [indecipherable 19:25] no change, the way they're saying to do it now. So like I said, it's either change that interface, or create a new interface.",60,discussing interface changes
A new interface is safer. It's a safer way to do it.,-1,explaining a design decision
"Yeah, because I don't think you want to change the part every time you get something in, because we wouldn't have any idea whether this was a part change or it's just receiving something in.",-1,expressing concern about process changes
I've got to see. Mike was thinking that those would be treated as two separate records. ,70,discussing data handling approach
"I hear what you're saying. We have a whole record leaving and a whole record coming in. To me, it would be changing the VIN.",-1,providing technical clarification
But you have to find it.,-1,requesting action

Last week was the first we heard of it. We never anticipated it or coded for it.,107,reporting unexpected issue

"Yes, if you had his list, say the primary fields are the Afinium locations, of whatever they call it, ship to, and then the address, city, state, zip code, and I liked Brian's first suggestion if you just go by the city, state, zip code and then maybe list them all side by side, and then the ones that match versus the ones that didn't, we could possibly get somebody to help manually do some of those to at least get started.",83,discussing data fields and manual data matching approach

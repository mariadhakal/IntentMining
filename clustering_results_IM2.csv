"Yeah. It's cryptic, so I apologize. Those two other formats for the pseudo-CLLIes. One of them starts with the four characters. Plant, followed by the state, followed by the sub-plant. The right two characters of the company. The other one is what I call the x-pseudos, where you have x company plant and sub-plant.",-1,explaining data format details

That's kind of almost a quirky, [indecipherable] thing to do, and I feel like exactly like what Susan motioned to do, like I'm kind of throwing a dart.",45,expressing concern about data integrity
"DJ, if I pull up 9WC0201, you're going to get a long list of company plants, different sub plants, and you're going to get some valid CLLI codes, and invalid ones.

I thought the exchange was a broader, defining area, so I was hoping.",45,explaining data structure and domain concept confusion
49] It sounds like that didn't work. What did we do with the net pseudos?,46,requesting clarification
"That was the lowly thing about net, is that each of the pseudos itself had the company code on there. In the net table itself, the CO profile table, there was that Infinium company code OAC in exchange field for each record.",45,explaining a technical detail
That's because we went in and cleaned those up prior to passing the data to you.,24,explaining completed work
"Which is going to be more difficult, and probably impossible to do in this case, because you could probably clean them up [indecipherable] extract 4, but then when we get the next extract, then there's going to be more stuff in there, potentially, that we haven't even considered. It would be nice if we had more broader swath.",-1,discussing data extraction challenges
"54] I like Jim's rules, that mindset of, if we had CLLI six, we could map it to an exchange that way. That was incredibly beneficial. It's just it's not fully working.",30,discussing technical approach and its limitations
"Don't you all have to, or somebody have to map these CLLIs to Infinium?",6,asking for task assignment clarification
The pseudo ones?,23,asking for clarification
Yeah. Or do they not use the pseudos in Infinium?,6,asking a clarifying question

They'll map it by...I'll check with the Infinium folks.,20,planning to consult with external team
"DJ, I know you haven't said this directly, but isn't some of the work that the IT department is going to be doing on this data before we get it, some of the work that they have to do so that Infinium will have their information on that, to the Verizon...?",20,seeking clarification about data processing responsibilities

"I said, I didn't finish my thought. Now remember, in Infinium, they don't even look at the CLLI code. [indecipherable] thing, so they're just looking at the company plant, sub plant, and going by the CO code and business unit. They're defining it that way. So, Infinium doesn't even look at these pseudo-CLLIs or CLLIs. Go ahead, DJ, I interrupted you to answer the other part.",6,explaining technical details
47] I just wanted to clarify.,0,seeking clarification
"No, that's good.",4,acknowledging completion

"No, it was out in California. 9WC was the company code.",68,providing background information
"Since the Infinium folks are going to have to deal with this, probably on the case-by-case basis as they encounter the new sub plants, I assume, could we put maybe a placeholder on these that we can't figure out and get them in that way? And then they could be dealt with on the case-by-case basis as they get encountered in LCAM? Is that a possibility?",6,requesting a provisional solution for unresolved items
"That's a good question. Ken, we need to get with Sarah, I think, [indecipherable] she's got to go into Infinium anyway, and fixed assets, so we should be able to get those exchanges.",-1,planning collaboration with team members

"So if that's true, then we could probably just come up with a pattern, like Drake said, of an exchange code. Because the exchange code helps me link back to that other file that DJ gave me that had that exhaustive list of LACs and company codes. I've had not a single problem matching up the exchange codes I've found back to that list, so I think that's perfect there.",13,proposing a solution based on existing data
"50] The only thing that I would need to put in there would be a place holder for the exchange code, the company code, and the OAC. If we just came up with some sort of thing that, it's blatantly obvious to whoever's using that part of LCAM, goes, ""Oh, yeah, I know I need to do this when I come across this,"" then that would at least get [indecipherable] through this part to the next thing.",45,requesting placeholder design guidance

"I know it was a real current thing, just recently an email about the ship via for pseudos. I don't know what I had said.",23,expressing uncertainty
"It was quite a while ago, and to be honest, it could have been you that said it or somebody else. Neither here nor there. That's the next barrier I'm coming across, is I need to know whether or not the G team's ship-to code is indeed a valid ship-to code for those locations that are in the extract. If they are, I'll need those addresses. I really just don't know where to find them, if they are in the extract or not.",13,requesting information about data validity and addresses
"54] If they're not, I need to strip those out, but we'd also need to know whether we can or can't ship a plug to one of those particular locations, and if something needs to go there, where it needs to be shipped to, via, to get there.",46,clarifying shipping requirements and constraints
"24] I hesitate to pull NetLogic out, because it seems to me like it'd be a mess if it got into LCAM without a via location specified, and somebody tried to ship something directly to someplace in the middle of nowhere.",30,expressing concern about code integration
"46] That seems like that would be a worse problem to clean up than the alternative, but I can do whatever you guys feel is the better of the two evils. If we can't get the ship-to's in time, that is. I know you're relying on somebody else to get us that information, I just...",46,expressing concern about data availability and cleanup options

"We probably aren't shipping to them, but I'm not sure all the intricacies between [indecipherable] and G teams, and how G teams was handling that. I haven't looked at the G teams data, either. Brian, have you been looking at the G teams data?",-1,expressing uncertainty about project details

It's Kevin.,17,introducing oneself
"Hey, Kevin. Yesterday Shield started sending receive equipment, notifications back to LCAM. Adam was looking at that. There are about 60, that were in the SEC stream, that we need you all to look at because they came across and got an SEC error.",20,reporting an issue with data stream errors
"The only error that's showing up right now is the [indecipherable 11:15] Not Found, so we need to track down exactly...",3,reporting a bug
"20] Some of that may be fallout, some of it may not. I've spot-checked several other and they weren't fallout so far, so there's this new [indecipherable 11:27] to us.

"It was not fallout, and it was not in the CL model. I know I spot-checked one yesterday.

Do we need to be here?,60,questioning meeting necessity
You don't have to stay.,67,giving permission to leave
We had some questions. We're trying to understand...Let me just pull it up.,61,expressing uncertainty and preparing to clarify
Can you see if Daryl is available?,-1,requesting availability check
"I don't have it on hand, but I can get started. Drake, we were on that call with Mike [indecipherable 15:25] . Remember, he had that flowchart of the interfaces between Infinium and CTDI, and LCAM and CTDI. You had identified two features or code changes that were outside the scope of the project. One of them was, where a part number and/or VIN changes.",20,referencing previous discussion and project scope
Yep.,1,noise
The other one was the nightly snapshots to check that we're all in sync.,59,reporting progress on synchronization tasks
Yes.,1,expressing agreement
"Correct? OK. The first one...I took notes, plus I double-checked the CTDI. We were under the impression, for those MRs, the finance issues and whatever the MR, that those could be worked through the existing code of send and receive. I was a little confused why that would be outside the scope.",45,expressing confusion
"26] Then the second one -- I thought, my notes were -- that LCAM agreed to just send a file [indecipherable 16:37] , like on an FTP server each night. Is that true?",9,asking for confirmation
"We hadn't decided. It could either be a service or a file, depending upon the size of that file, how much data...",20,discussing implementation options
"Were you sending it to them, or they were sending it to you?",27,requesting clarification
"No, we were creating, depending on which way we were doing it. If we create a service, they would pull it whenever they wanted. If it was an FTP, then we would send it to them or put it on the FTP site, daily or however often it was run.",54,explaining data delivery methods
"To tackle the first one, first. You're saying that Mike suggested to use existing interfaces, is not appropriate or what...",31,seeking clarification
The existing interface doesn't change part numbers now. We would either have to change the existing interface to make it change part numbers -- which is not what the interface is designed for -- or we create a new interface to allow them to change part numbers. That's all they're doing with it.,15,explaining design options for interface modification
"59] Either way, it'll be a change for us. It is not like we could just allow them to send it to the existing interface and it'll change the part with what they want.",15,explaining a technical constraint
Wasn't that a two part thing? One with...,49,expressing uncertainty
"Yeah, part or a serial number. VIN number.",68,providing clarification
"OK, but short of changing the part number, I thought the MR, the old part number would go out and the new one would come in.",54,clarifying a process or behavior
"Yeah, that's...",47,noise
Would that really...?,-1,expressing confusion
We seem to have one that's still bringing back in...,60,reporting a bug
"We're just trying to make sure, before we accept the digital feed that.",-1,clarifying requirements
We still wouldn't change that.,34,expressing status quo maintenance
We might need an expert. We're a little confused.,61,expressing emotion
"Their proposal was to send it out as one part number and then we would send another message, have it coming back in as a different part number. Still, the code doesn't change the part number when it comes in, it [indecipherable 19:03] that VIN and moves that VIN where it needs to be. It doesn't change the base equipment on that, that VIN.",9,explaining current system behavior
[19:13] It wouldn't be treated like take the old one out and replace it with the new one?,63,asking for clarification on process
"No. Basically it would [indecipherable 19:25] no change, the way they're saying to do it now. So like I said, it's either change that interface, or create a new interface.",3,discussing interface changes
A new interface is safer. It's a safer way to do it.,15,explaining a design decision
"Yeah, because I don't think you want to change the part every time you get something in, because we wouldn't have any idea whether this was a part change or it's just receiving something in.",31,expressing concern about process changes
I've got to see. Mike was thinking that those would be treated as two separate records. ,31,discussing data handling approach
"I hear what you're saying. We have a whole record leaving and a whole record coming in. To me, it would be changing the VIN.",-1,providing technical clarification
But you have to find it.,67,requesting action
[20:23],3,noise

It was never asked for up front.,-1,clarifying requirements
First time we heard of it was last week.,22,providing background information
Last week was the first we heard of it. We never anticipated it or coded for it.,33,reporting unexpected issue

"Exactly, yeah. One way, just along those lines, that you can differentiate the stuff that you're inserting from the stuff that we inserted is to put something in the legacy ID field that tells you this is the stuff we did.",20,suggesting a method to differentiate data sources
"02] That's kind of what we've used. We started using it because, for the Verizon assets, they wanted to keep up with the sequence number but then Brian was also using it to keep up with other data that he entered.",20,explaining usage rationale

"08] Number two is use some sort of Fuzzy Logic magic to group up data in that spreadsheet to data in LCAM to get a CLLI so that they can map a location code to the CLLI code change on CTDI's part.

"54] I don't know how many that would end up being, but that seems like it would be a pretty simple query to perform is just take what we have on that spreadsheet, take what we have in LCAM, do a join based on the address fields.",13,proposing a data query approach
"11] There might be 10,000 location codes in there. You might end up with a thousand matches, but at least that's a thousand that you would have that we don't have to look at again. That would be low-hanging fruit to me.",68,suggesting an approach to reduce workload

"That makes sense, because it's his data.",20,acknowledging information
That's fine.,4,acknowledging agreement
He gets it from Afinium. He's already been set up with Afinium for a while.,30,providing status update
"We need to get that list, and then if we can do like Brian said, just be able to get an exact match on the address information, then we can find the CLLI based on that. I don't know how many would be an exact match versus ones that are close.",13,discussing data matching approach
"Yes, if you had his list, say the primary fields are the Afinium locations, of whatever they call it, ship to, and then the address, city, state, zip code, and I liked Brian's first suggestion if you just go by the city, state, zip code and then maybe list them all side by side, and then the ones that match versus the ones that didn't, we could possibly get somebody to help manually do some of those to at least get started.",13,discussing data fields and manual data matching approach
"15] Or if your first pass is with the city or the address, then the second pass leave that out and see if it's close. Does Afinium or LCAM, what's your quantity of ship via CLLIs?",30,requesting information
I don't know how many we have.,11,expressing uncertainty
That's a good question.,35,expressing emotion
I was just looking at that.,55,expressing progress status
Let me get with Mike. I'll have him send what he has. If he doesn't then I'll have to get with Afinium's whole team to see if we can get what they have.,30,coordinating information gathering

He didn't set it up yet?,59,inquiring about setup status
"Well, apparently he did it maybe instead of...I thought it was supposed to be the night before last at midnight, but apparently that didn't happen, and maybe it happened last night at midnight, because we did see some that came in early this morning that were adds and that's as far as we got to look.",59,providing status update on task timing

"I've created some scripts. I would do it, personally, but sometimes our VPN connection is a little iffy and to have it drop in the middle of like extracting the assets, that could be a two-hour process. That would be quite painful.",64,explaining work approach and challenges
